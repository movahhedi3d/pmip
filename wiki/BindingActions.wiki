Once you've written a PMIPAction you need to bind it so that intellij has some means of executing it.

The 'bind' method (on [http://code.google.com/p/pmip/source/browse/trunk/pmip/plugins/core/lib/binder.rb Binder]) binds an instance of a PMIPAction.

{{{
bind HelloWorldAction.new
}}}

As a result the action with appear in the 'PMIP' menu

You may optionally bind to a java Keystroke (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/KeyStroke.html)

{{{
bind 'ctrl alt shift A', HelloWorldAction.new
}}}

As a large number of keystrokes in intellij are already taken, it's usually safest to go for 'ctrl alt shift' (something) combinations. This combination has become known as 'banana' (imagine your left hand like a bunch of bananas) and so the 'banana' shortcut is supported by bind

Therefore:

{{{
bind 'banana A', HelloWorldAction.new
}}}
and
{{{
bind 'ctrl alt shift A', HelloWorldAction.new
}}}

both mean the same. 

Your action can now be executed by invoking it in the PMIP menu or by hitting the keystroke (if specified)
