==How do I install/use rubygems?==

It's far from ideal, but it is possible to install gems (obviously make sure they are jruby compatible versions!) from the command line.

In order to do this you'll need to locate your intellij settings directory and then run the following:

{{{
java -jar {INTELLIJ_SETTINGS_DIRECTORY}/config/plugins/PMIP/lib/jruby-complete-x.x.x.jar --command jgem install {GEM_FILE}
}}}

For example, to install the hpricot gem:
{{{
java -jar C:/dev/settings/.IntelliJIdea90/config/plugins/PMIP/lib/jruby-complete-x.x.x.jar --command jgem install hpricot-x.x.x-java.gem
}}}

Once installed you can then require the gem in the normal way, note that you may also need to require 'rubygems' first.

In future, I hope that there might be a more elegant method of installing gems from within PMIP, but I've not found it yet - all suggestions welcome!
