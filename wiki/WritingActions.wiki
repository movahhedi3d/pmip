Actions are the simplest method of adding functionality to your plugin (see also: WritingServlets).

To write your action simply extend [http://code.google.com/p/pmip/source/browse/trunk/pmip/plugins/core/lib/action.rb PMIPAction] and implement the run() method.

A few things to note:
 * PMIPAction extends intellij's AnAction
 * 'event' is intellij's AnActionEvent 
 * context is a [http://code.google.com/p/pmip/source/browse/trunk/pmip/plugins/core/lib/context.rb PMIPContext]

{{{
class HelloWorldAction < PMIPAction
  def run(event, context)
    Balloon.new(context).info(''Hello from PMIP!')
  end
end
}}}
