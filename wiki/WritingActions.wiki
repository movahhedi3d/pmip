Actions are the simplest method of adding functionality to your plugin (see also: WritingServlets).

To write your action simply extend PMIPAction and implement the run() method.

Note that PMIPAction extend intellij's AnAction

{{{
class HelloWorldAction < PMIPAction
  def run(event, context)
    Balloon.new(context).info(''Hello from PMIP!')
  end
end
}}}
