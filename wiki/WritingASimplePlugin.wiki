To create a new plugin, simply add the following line, to your pmip.rb, where 'xyz' is the name of your plugin.

{{{
plugin 'xyz'
}}}

Press 'Reset' and PMIP will have create the following structure for you:

{{{
plugins/xyz/
           /lib
           /init.rb
}}}

Whenever you press 'Reset', PMIP will now execute plugins/xyz/init.rb

Generally plugin code is stored in 'lib' and init.rb simply loads the code and binds actions to keypress - see the ExamplePlugins for further details.

Note that, it you must use 'load' instead of 'require' because like IRB, PMIP will not reload previously required files.
