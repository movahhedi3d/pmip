The 'bind' method (on [http://code.google.com/p/pmip/source/browse/trunk/pmip/plugins/core/lib/binder.rb Binder]) will bind an instance of a PMIPAction to a java Keystroke (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/KeyStroke.html)

For example:

{{{
bind 'ctrl alt shift A', HelloWorldAction.new
}}}

As a large number of keystrokes in intellij are already taken, it's usually safest to go for 'ctrl alt shift' (something) combinations. This combination has become known as 'banana' (imagine your left hand like a bunch of bananas) and so the 'banana' shortcut is supported by bind

Therefore:

{{{
bind 'banana A', HelloWorldAction.new
}}}
and
{{{
bind 'ctrl alt shift A', HelloWorldAction.new
}}}

both mean the same. 

Note also that binding an action also adds it to the 'PMIP' menu.
